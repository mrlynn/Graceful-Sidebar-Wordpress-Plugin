== Description ==

This plugin enables you to customize your blog's sidebar using custom fields.  

== Installation ==

1. Upload all the files into your wp-content/plugins directory, be sure to put them into a folder called "graceful_sidebar" - name is important.
1. Activate the plugin at the plugin administration page
1. Create a custom field in a post called "graceful_title" and "graceful_content"
1. Drag the "Graceful Sidebar" Widget to one of the sidebars in your theme.

Please see the [graceful_sidebar plugin home page](http://mlynn.org/graceful-sidebar-plugin/) for details

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the plugin only display a blank title? =
Most likely because you have another plugin in your sidebar that is changing the focus of the current post.  By the time wordpress gets to the task of displaying Graceful Sidebar's content it doesn't know what the current post or page is.
